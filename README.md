To create a maven project IntelliJ IDEA we open the IDE, go to File -> New -> Project -> Maven Archetype <br>
We select the name we want for the project and its location (option to create a git repository) <br>
The catalog should be "Maven Central" <br>
Archetype should be "org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart"<br>
On "Advanced Settings"  we can write the "groupId" and the "ArtifactId"<br>
Press create and it's done. <br>

Use "-Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false" to stop showing the thread warning when running the project
